Perfect ✅ — so you want the same full-stack system, but branded and structured for Panorama Maths Tutors, not St. Mary’s.
Everything — including the Paynow (Ecocash) integration, MongoDB + Catbox backend, admin upload system, frontend (React + Tailwind + Glassmorphism + Framer Motion + Lucide icons) — should now reflect the Panorama Maths Tutors brand, style, and goals.

Here’s your final full master prompt 👇

💳 4️⃣ PAYNOW (ECOCASH) INTEGRATION

Replace Stripe — use Paynow Zimbabwe API for instant mobile payments.

Flow:

1. Student selects a Premium Course.


2. System asks for Econet mobile number.


3. Sends { userId, courseId, phone } to /api/paynow/create-mobile-payment.


4. Server creates a payment using:

const paynow = new Paynow(INTEGRATION_ID, INTEGRATION_KEY);
const payment = paynow.createPayment("Panorama Maths Course", user.email);
payment.add(courseName, price);
const response = await paynow.sendMobile(payment, phone, "ecocash");


5. User approves Ecocash prompt on phone.


6. Paynow sends result to /api/paynow/result.


7. Server validates hash → updates MongoDB: status: "paid".


8. Frontend polls /api/payments/:id/status until paid.


9. Once confirmed → unlocks course for user access.



Backend Setup:

npm install paynow express mongoose dotenv cors body-parser

.env:

PAYNOW_INTEGRATION_ID=your_id
PAYNOW_INTEGRATION_KEY=your_key
PAYNOW_RESULT_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api/paynow/result

Would you like me to compress this into a single one-paragraph AI build command (ready to paste into a code-generation model like Replit, v0.dev, or Cursor)?
That version would generate both frontend + backend boilerplate automatically.
